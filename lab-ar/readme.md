AR Lab: canihealarlab

For this lab I set up a prototype for an AR furniture app. 
It is demonstrated using a sofa but if the app were completed it would offer a variety of different furniture the user could select. 
The idea behind this app is that it would allow the user to see how their room would look with different furniture in it before they buy it.
